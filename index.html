  <h2>Hey, I'm Key</h2>
  <p>I'm a web developer and software engineer hailing from Baltimore, Maryland but currently living in Chicago, Illinois.</p> 
  <p>As a lover of all things design, I'm interested in:<ul>
    <li>Building virtual spaces with code</li>
    <li>Creating mockups with like minded coders</li>
  </ul></p>
    <p>Please take a look at my work and feel free to <a href="#contact-me">contact me</a></p>

  <h2>About Key</h2>
  <p>I've always had a passion for being creative and solving problems. What better way to incorporate both of these things then software engineering and web designing! </p>
  <p>With a background in graphic design, it was only natural to want to explore the world of coding. Along with putting my own creative spin in 2D-design, I'm also intrigued by the works of 3-dimentional spaces in inter decorating. I one day hope to be able to bring my passion for graphics, interiors, and coding together into one realm.</p>
    <p>As a Thinkful student, I'm excited to venture into the world of software engineering. I look forward to working with other like minded designers to build wonderful software together. If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out!  </p>
